# maptoolkit
This toolkit contains UI components and utilities that help simplify your Qt app development using Python.

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the maptoolkit offering Python-based sample apps using ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt. This toolkit shows how to use [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6) and ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt to build native desktop apps that incorporate capabilities such as 2D and 3D data visualization, geocoding, routing, and geoprocessing, for deployment on Windows, Linux, and macOS desktop devices.

Software Requirements
---------------------

The maptoolkit depends on the following software packages:

- [geoint-mapping](https://github.com/gisfromscratch/geoint-mapping): Core mapping and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capabilities for Python.
- [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt - Version 200.4](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt): ArcGIS Maps SDK for Qt has APIs for developing desktop apps for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and mobile apps for iOS and Android. You can install the API on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- [Qt for Python - Version 6.5.2](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6): The future is written with Qt, the cross-platform software development framework.
